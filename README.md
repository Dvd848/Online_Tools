# Online_Tools
A collection of small miscellaneous online tools.

- [Bit Parser](https://dvd848.github.io/Online_Tools/Bit_Parser.html) - A tiny HTML utility for modifying and inspecting bits in a DWORD. Similar to the Windows calculator UI, but (hopefully) not as annoying.
- [Bit Field Parser](https://dvd848.github.io/Online_Tools/Bit_Field_Parser.html) - A tiny HTML utility for modifying and inspecting bits in a DWORD-based bit-field.
- [XML Filter](https://dvd848.github.io/Online_Tools/XML_Filter.html) - An HTML utility to filter XMLs. Originally built to handle a large and unorganized XML where data relevant for one logical entity is scattered across the file.
